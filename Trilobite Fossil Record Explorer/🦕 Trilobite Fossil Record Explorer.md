# ü¶ï Trilobite Fossil Record Explorer

An interactive Tableau dashboard visualizing the fossil record of trilobites ‚Äî ancient marine arthropods that lived for over 270 million years. This project explores their diversity, distribution, and paleoecology through time and space.

---

## üìä Dashboard Overview

The **Trilobite Fossil Record Explorer** includes the following visualizations:

1. **Specimen Count by Time Period**
   - Bar chart showing fossil occurrences by geologic period.
   - Highlights diversity peaks and extinction events.

2. **Global Fossil Distribution Map**
   - Map of fossil sites using latitude and longitude.
   - Colored by time period or taxonomic order.

3. **Environment vs. Life Habit Matrix**
   - Compares paleoenvironment (e.g., marine, reef) with life habits (e.g., epifaunal).
   - Reveals ecological trends in trilobite behavior and habitat.

## üß† Key Insights

- Trilobites were most diverse during the **Cambrian** and **Ordovician** periods.
- Fossils are most concentrated in **North America** and **Europe**.
- Most trilobites lived in **shallow marine environments** as **bottom-dwelling scavengers**.
